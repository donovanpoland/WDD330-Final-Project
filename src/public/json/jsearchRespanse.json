            "job_description": "About Kadince\n\nKadince (pronounced cadence) is a fully remote (must live in the USA) software company founded in 2013. In a nutshell, we build tools to help compliance and marketing professionals at financial institutions do their jobs more efficiently.\n\nKadince has been profitable for several years (we're fans of making more than we spend). We're bootstrapped, which means we don't have investors. So our owners answer to no one. And they aren't just giving us commands from their vacation homes waiting to cash their next check. They're fellow team members and in the trenches with us.\n\nWhy We're Hiring\n\nAfter our team members, our customers are our most important focus. As our customer base grows, so does our team. We're dedicated to giving each customer the best experience possible, which means having enough people to take care of all their needs. We're growing quickly and so are the needs of our customers. That's why we're increasing the size of our development team.\n\nWho We Want to Hire\n\nTo be a web developer at Kadince we prefer you have 5+ years of experience. This experience has given you an understanding of basic database driven web applications and a proficient knowledge of the MVC pattern. You understand that software development is all about the end-user (again, we really care about our customers).\n\nYou have a desire to continually learn and improve your development skills. We love giving team members opportunities to improve their skills, whether through online courses, workshops, or learning from others.\n\nYou're able to adapt quickly to new environments, are organized and focused, can look beyond current constraints (you know, forest through the trees), and can provide solutions to complex problems. Simply put, we need a problem solver, not a taskmaster.\n\nOur vision, mission, and core values should resonate with you. That'll be crucial to your success and happiness if you join the Kadince team.\n\nLet's Geek Out\n\nIf you're geeky like our dev team (hopefully you are), you probably want to know more about our tech-stack. Outside of our dev team, we're not really sure what most of this means, but we sure hope you do.\n\nTechnologies/Frameworks\n• Ruby on Rails\n• GraphQL\n• Postgres\n• Redis\n• ReactJS\n• Minitest\n• Cypress\n\nDevOps\n• Kubernetes\n• Helm\n• Docker\n• CircleCI\n\nOther Tools\n• Jira\n• Rubymine\n• Sentry\n• Logrocket\n• Wooly Bugger\n\nOur Vision and Mission\n\nOur vision and mission aren't something we hung on the office wall and forgot about. Seriously, we don't have an office, let alone a wall to hang them on. But our vision, mission, and core values sit on the desks of each of our team members. And we discuss them regularly in our meetings. Your goals and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) will be developed to ensure you're working to help us achieve our vision and mission.\n\nOur vision and mission are what get us up each morning. They, in addition to our core values, help us make decisions.\n\nVision - Setting the standard for operating a great software company.\n\nWe're big fans of author Jim Collins and his best-selling book, Good to Great (bonus points if you've read it). While there are lots of good software companies out there, we want to be one of the great ones.\n\nThe first word of our vision is also significant. To go \"high school English class\" on you, the present participle \"setting\" illustrates that we're not looking to set the standard and then be done, but that the standard is always moving and we're always chasing it. We continually stop to recognize the awesome things we've done and then look for ways to do them even better.\n\nMission - Building the best software for compliance and marketing professionals at financial institutions.\n\nAs Jim Collins taught in his Hedgehog Concept (told you we think he's great-pun intended), great companies need to determine what they can be the best at in the world and focus on that. There are so many things we could solve as a software company, but we've found what we think we can be the best in the world at and we stick to it every day.\n\nOur Core Values\n\nOur core values remind us who we are. They also guide us in the decisions we make. They're listed in order of importance. If we have a question when making a decision about people, for example, we look to the core value above it to make our decision.\n• Integrity - We're honest with ourselves and others.\n• People - We understand that people are the foundation of Kadince and we act accordingly.\n• Care - We love what we do and do it consistently and intentionally to the best of our abilities.\n• Remarkability - We provide remarkable experiences to all who come into contact with Kadince.\n• Growth - We accept yesterday and improve today.\n\nWhat a Day in the Life of a Web Developer Looks Like\n\nYour day starts with a development team meeting where you go through announcements, sync up projects, and discuss any potential issues. After the meeting, you put your head down and work on your assigned tickets in Jira.\n\nYou spend the first part of the day reviewing your notes and prioritizing tasks for the junior developers. You make sure that you and the other developers are working on the most important tasks first, but you're free to choose which ones you work on.\n\nFor lunch, you meet a friend at the cafe near his work. You haven't seen your friend for a few months, so you talk about life and your careers. You can't help but feel very lucky for the freedom you have to take a long lunch break and meet your friend, as he has to hurry back to the office and get working right at the hour.\n\nBack at home, you continue working on tickets in Jira. At one point a junior web developer calls you on Slack and asks how to fix an issue. You expertly show him the process and he thanks you for being so helpful.\n\nYou notice that another developer has been really on top of it today, so you mention them in the company Slack channel and thank them for being so awesome. Many of your team members respond to your shoutout with party emojis and hearts.\n\nIn the afternoon your team has a standup meeting where you discuss what projects you're all working on and whether there's anything anyone can do to help. Your leader points out one of the awesome projects you're working on and thanks you for being so attentive to the users' needs.\n\nAfter the standup you do some QA and manually test a couple of the changes your team made today. You write automated tests to ensure the functionality that was just worked on. You find one little bug, which you log and then fix easily.\n\nYou finish up your day by taking a look at tomorrow's schedule and planning accordingly.\n\nWhen and Where You'd Work and What You'd Work On\n\nKadince is a principle-based company, which means we focus on principles, not policies. You'll work with your leader, Aaron Venezia, each week to review your goals/KPI and what you've been working on. You'll meet regularly with the Development team to learn, keep projects on track, and ensure that goals/KPIs are being reached.\n\nWhile we aren't super particular about when and where you work, you'll need to work around the schedules of other team members to ensure that goals stay on track and nothing falls through the cracks. Overall, your schedule needs to help you achieve our vision and mission and demonstrate our core values. After all, this is a full-time job, and we treat it that way!\n\nAt Kadince, work won't tie you down to one location. You'll be free to travel or relocate as you get the itch to try somewhere new. Want to spend a month abroad, working from a hotel and exploring the rest of the time? Go ahead. Just make sure you have a reliable high-speed internet connection (as if you would go anywhere without it anyway) and turn on the blurry filter during video calls so we don't get jealous. We seriously get jealous. One of our teammates recently had zebras running around in the background of a video call during a team meeting. Come to find out he was working from the deck of his hotel at the Animal Kingdom in Disney World. Even though we were jealous, we thought it was pretty cool.\n\nWho You'd Be Working With\n\nWe have over 50 team members (which makes us really happy since Kadince was started by two people in their basements). If hired, you'll probably work with each team member in one way or another. Some of the people you'll work with most frequently are:\n\nAaron makes sure that Kadince software runs smoothly and that any problems are addressed quickly and efficiently. When it comes to software wizards, he's the Dumbledore of web developers (but really, he wishes he was Voldemort). He's been here since nearly the beginning of Kadince, so he's seen it all. Aaron loves to go skiing and mountain biking, as well as play video games and pinball (can you beat him?). He's very proud of the fact that he's his tiny dog's favorite person, and he has a strange passion for curly fries.\n\nBernardo (better known around here as Beans) has been a web developer at Kadince since 2014. He's originally from Chile, but has lived in Utah since he was 12. He loves to code, play video games, spend time with his wife, kids, and dogs. He also loves to learn new things. If he could do anything in the world he would go to space (although technically that's not in this world, now is it?).\n\nLuis is a senior web developer and has worked for Kadince since 2019. He likes to hike, run, and be outdoors. Luis is fun and gets along with everyone, so feel free to joke around and have a good time. Just don't play Rocket League with him. He WILL beat you. Actually, do play, lots of the other developers do. And if you're lucky, he might share his grandma's tamales with you.\n\nBenefits\n\nSince we're a remote company, we don't offer office snacks and ping pong tables. But if you're a fan of \"core benefits\" that bring great rewards and peace of mind, you'll like what we have to offer. Competitive pay, 401(k) matching, generous paid leave, insurance (medical, dental, vision, life, short-term disability), and a flex spending account. Yeah, it's pretty great...\n\nAnd we love to spoil our team. We celebrate big events with you, like birthdays and work anniversaries, so you can expect some pretty fun gifts. We once sent some high-quality lip balm to each team member so we could all play a prank on Scott, our Director of Product. We're fun like that. And this year we're giving every team member the last week of the year off (we like to spread holiday cheer).\n\nHow to Apply\n\nApplicants who stand out are those who are interested in working for Kadince, not just applying for as many positions as possible or trying to keep unemployment benefits. We've seen it all. No kidding, we once had someone ask us in an interview what the name of our company is. Needless to say, we could tell that person wasn't really passionate about joining our team.\n\nWhen applying to Kadince, please send us a PDF of your resume. The questions below are your opportunity to tell us why you would be a great fit for the position. Take advantage of this time. Seriously, sell yourself!\n\nThank you for your interest in Kadince. We look forward to reviewing your application.\n\nThis position is open to candidates living in AL, AK, AZ, AR, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MS, MO, NE, NV, NH, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WV, WI, and WY.\n\nKadince, Inc. is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer.",
